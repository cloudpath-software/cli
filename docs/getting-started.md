This guide will walk you through installing the CLI.

## Installation

1. **Install the CLI globally**

   ```

**Important:** When using the CLI in a CI environment we recommend installing it locally. See more [here](https://github.com/cloudpath-software/cli#installation).

2. **Login to your Cloudpath Account**

   cloudpath login
   ```
